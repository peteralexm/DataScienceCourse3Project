# DataScienceCourse3Project

The script run_analysis.R does the following operations with Human Activity Recognition Dataset:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and stores in as a text file "tidy.txt" in the working directory.

The Dataset should be placed in the working directory for the correct performance of the script.

CODEBOOK

The variables are taken from Human Activity Recognition Dataset and represent the smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial signals coming from group of 30 volunteers performing different activities.
The original dataset and the Codebook is available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
